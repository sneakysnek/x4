  ~ Changes from X3 ~

    OVERVIEW:

    This is a basic list and explaination of changes we have planned for X4 while migrating commands
    from X3. This list will continue to grow and change with the more we put into development and
    subject to change based on the needs and wants of the development team and it's sponsors.


    CHANGES:

    Languages - Unlike X3, X4 will be designed with other languages in mind so even if your community
                doesn't know English, you can still use X4. By default, the language will be English.

    Modules - X4 will be designed completely with modules in mind. You will be able to enable and
              disable modules on the fly for ease of use.

    Ban System - The new ban system will replace the legacy 'lamer' system with integrated shared
                 bans between the IRCd and services. Using the banlist command will show both active
                 X4 channel bans as well as bans set with /mode +b. (We will be keeping timed ban
                 support however!)
